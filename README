HOW TO INSTALL:

Mac

You must have XCode installed (you need gcc). XCode comes on a CD with
your Mac. Go to the project root directory and type:
make
ruby tests/test_generator.rb

Probably you don't need to install ruby --- it's already installed.


Linux

If you're Ubuntu user, download and install binutils and ruby:
sudo apt-get install -y binutils ruby

After that, go to the project root directory and type:
make
ruby tests/test_generator.rb

If you're using another Linux distribution, use appropriate package manager.


Windows

Download and install MinGW (http://www.mingw.org), and all you need to
build the project is to open command window, go to the project
directory and type:
make

But it's also possible to build this project with Microsoft Visual
Studio. To do this, create New project in Visual Studio and add all
files from src/ subdirectory.

Also, download and install ruby from http://rubyinstaller.org.  After
installation, type in command window (from project directory):
ruby tests/test_generator.rb

HOW TO USE:

After installation you will find sorter binary in bin/ subdirectory.
Type in console (command window for Windows users):
bin/sorter (bin\sorter for Windows users).

You'll see 'usage' message which describes how to use this program.
For instance, type:
bin/sorter randomized_quick_sort < tests/random_10.txt

NOTE: If you use Visual Studio and need the binaries it's up to you to
find them.
